    <summary>Your Swiss Army Knife for Databases and SQL</summary>
    <description>## Intelligent query console
Allows you to execute queries in different modes and provides local history that keeps track of all your activity and protects you from losing your work.

## Efficient schema navigation
Lets you jump to any table, view, or procedure by its name via corresponding action, or directly from its usages in the SQL code.

## Explain plan
Gives you an extended insight into how your queries work and into database engine behavior so you can make your queries more efficient.

## Smart code completion
DataGrip provides context-sensitive code completion, helping you to write SQL code faster. Completion is aware of the tables structure, foreign keys, and even database objects created in code you're editing.

## On-the-fly analysis and quick-fixes
DataGrip detects probable bugs in your code and suggests the best options to fix them on the fly. It will immediately let you know about unresolved objects, using keywords as identifiers and always offers the way to fix problems.

## Refactorings that work in SQL files and schemas
DataGrip correctly resolves all references in your SQL code and helps you refactor them. When you rename a variable or an alias, it will update their usages throughout the entire file. Even the actual table names in the database are updated when you rename references to them from your queries.

## Version control integration
We provide unified support for all major version control systems: Git, SVN, Mercurial and many others.</description>
